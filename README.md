# Recommender Systems with Python
This project focuses on building recommender systems using Python. 

In this notebook, I focused on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies.
Also, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately, it just tells what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.

This project explores different methods for building recommender systems, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybridÂ approaches.
